 *
 * History -
 *  CopyTrader and MAM are two modules in Webtrader which requires token validation.
 *  This token is not user's token. It is either traders' or other users' token.
 *  In order to understand more about what these tokens are, please visit these screens.
 *  I had a detailed discussion with backend team. As of 13th Nov 2017, either there
 *  are no backend resources to create new API for token validation or they are
 *  reluctant to do so. Based on my discussion with Tom, he recommended this approach
 *  for now.
